GitHub Guide Tutorial - A Synopsis of Dr. Strangelove (1963)

  Stanley Kubrick's black comedy classic about an "accidental" nuclear attack received four Oscan nominations. Convinced the Communists want to pollute America's "precious bodily fluids", a crazed general orders a nuclear air strike on the USSR. As his aide, Captain Mandrake scrambles to unlock a recall code to prevent the bombing, the US President calls a drunken Soviet Permier on the hotline claiming the proposed attack is a silly mistake, while the president's advisor Dr. Strangelove verifies the existence of a dreaded Doomsday machine - a retaliatory device designed by the Soviets to end the human race once and for all!
