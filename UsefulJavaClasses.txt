USEFUL JAVA CLASSES

TRY BLOCKS
	A try block is used to contain statements that may cause an exception during execution.
	There can be multiple catch() blocks. It looks like this:
	
	try {
			//code to execute
	}
	catch (Exception type) {
			//code to execute if there is a problem with above statments
	}
	catch (Exception type) {

	}
	finally {
			//optional, but usually recommended to use
			//for example, if a file exception is thrown, you can use this block to close file	
	}
	
SCANNER CLASS (READING FROM A FILE)
	Scanner classes can be used for all types of input, whether that input is from a file, or typed in
	the console by the user. This is an example of reading strings from a file.
	
	import java.util.Scanner;
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		Scanner	buffer = null; //Creates an empty instance of the Scanner class called "buffer"
		
		buffer = new Scanner(new File("filename.txt")); //Reads from "filename.txt" to "buffer"
		
		while (buffer.hasNext()) {
			token = in.next();	//assigns scanned input to "token"
			
			Scanner in = new Scanner(token); //Scans contents of "token"
			
			//Code below will use/manipulate token
			
		} 						
	
	}
	
	hasNext() method: returns true if the scanner has another token in its input
	next() method: finds and returns next complete token from this scanner
	
	Other methods for this class can be found at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html

STRING CLASS
	To tokenize a Java String Object, given some string s; we can use s.splits(delim); This will tokenize
	the s string based on whatever delimiter you enter as splits argument. Each token generated by this
	method will be assigned to a String[] array. Syntax below:

		String s = "Hello World";
		String[] splits = s.split(" "); // The space character is our delimiter
		System.out.println(splits[0]);	// Prints out "Hello"
		System.out.println(splits[1]);	// Prints out "World"
		System.out.println(splits[0] + splits[1]);	// Prints "HelloWorld"

LAB 2 GRADES CLASS
	Each student will have their own Grades Object

	Types

	private static name
	int length // number of grades per student
	int minimum
	int maximum
	double average
	double median

	Methods
